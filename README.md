# Word-Guess-Game
A word guessing game similar to "Hangman"

This project is a game similar to the classic game "Hangman" except that this version is limited to unusual colors for its word choices.

How to play:

Press any letter key on the keyboard to guess that letter.
The game will automatically fill in the letters where they appear in the randomly selected word.
Any letters that have been guessed will be displayed in the "Letters Guessed" section.
If you guess the entire word before you run out of guesses you will win the game!
If you run out of guesses, you lose!
